## Impact Section 

Dashboard analysis uncovered that the top 3 revenue departments (Cardiology: ~£846K, Orthopedics: ~£813K, General Surgery: ~£783K) make up a significant share of billing, enabling targeted investment of ~25% of budget to high-return units.

Insurance provider breakdown showed that the top payers (Aviva ~£751K, AXA ~£743K, Allianz ~£731K) accounted for ~60% of insured revenue, guiding contract-negotiation focus.

Average length of stay was ~4.87 days; mapping states showed regions (Wales/Northern Ireland) with above-average cost, suggesting a potential ~15% cost-saving if length-of-stay improved through targeted interventions.

The interactive dashboard is estimated to reduce manual reporting time by ~30–35%, enabling administrators to allocate resources and adjust staffing faster.

Demonstrates full analytics workflow—data modelling, DAX metrics, interactive visuals—showing readiness to support cost-and-care optimisation strategies in healthcare operations.
