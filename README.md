----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üìä Project Overview
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project focuses on analyzing the financial performance of a healthcare center and providing insights on healthcare providers. Using Power BI, an interactive dashboard was built to help stakeholders easily monitor KPIs, trends, and provider efficiency.

The goal of this project was to translate raw healthcare data into actionable insights that can guide strategic decisions, improve provider performance, and enhance overall financial health.

üéØ Objectives
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Identify and present Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for healthcare finance and provider performance.

Perform a detailed analysis of revenue, expenses, and provider efficiency.

Build an interactive, multi-page dashboard to summarize insights.

Communicate findings with clarity using effective data visualization.

üìë Dashboard Structure
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The dashboard consists of 3‚Äì4 interactive pages:

Revenue Growth: Overall revenue showed a steady upward trend, with noticeable seasonal peaks in Q2 and Q4.

Cost Patterns: Operational costs rose in parallel with revenue, suggesting potential inefficiencies in resource allocation.

Provider Performance:

A few providers contributed disproportionately to total revenue, while some underperformed despite similar patient volumes.

High-efficiency providers tended to handle a larger patient load with shorter consultation times.

Patient Trends: An increase in repeat visits indicated growing patient retention, a positive sign for long-term sustainability.

Incentive Programs ‚Äì Introduce performance-based incentives for providers to encourage higher efficiency and quality of care.

Focus on Retention ‚Äì Leverage patient retention trends by offering wellness programs and follow-up care packages.

Strategic Forecasting ‚Äì Use seasonal revenue patterns to plan staffing, resource allocation, and marketing campaigns.
