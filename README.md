----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📊 Project Overview
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project focuses on analyzing the financial performance of a healthcare center and providing insights on healthcare providers and resource allocation. Using Power BI, an interactive dashboard was built to help stakeholders easily monitor KPIs, trends, and provider efficiency.

The goal of this project was to translate raw healthcare data into actionable insights that can guide strategic decisions, improve provider performance, and enhance overall financial health.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. KPIs and Trends: Identify and present the key 
performance indicators (KPIs) and significant trends in the 
dataset. 
2. Detailed Analysis: Ensure the analysis is thorough and 
detailed, covering all relevant aspects of the healthcare 
center's finance and the performance of healthcare 
providers. 
3. Dashboard Creation: Create a comprehensive 
dashboard consisting of 3 to 4 pages that includes: - Financial Overview: Summarize the financial health of 
the healthcare center. - Provider Insights: Analyze the performance and 
efficiency of healthcare providers. 
- Trend Analysis: Highlight any important trends over 
time. - Additional Insights: Any other relevant insights that can 
be derived from the data.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Expectations: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Visualization: Use appropriate visualizations to effectively 
communicate the findings. - Interactivity: Ensure the dashboard is interactive and 
user-friendly. - Clarity: Present the data in a clear and concise manner, 
making it easy for stakeholders to understand the insights. 

📑 Dashboard Structure
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The dashboard consists of interactive Dashboard consisting the below:

Financial Overview

- Summarizes Total Revenue, Medication cost, Treatment Cost, Insurance cost, Room charges and out-of-pocket that the patients had to pay from their pocket despite the insurance coverage. 
- Provides a snapshot of the healthcare center’s financial health.
- Maps visualize total revenue by states. Blue indicating high revenue and red indicating low revenue states. Added a sclicer to visualize the revenue by city and state. 
- Total revenue by procedure is visualized with a Clsutered column chart indicating the highest revenue generated from X-rays followed by CT-scan and MRI Scan.
- Total revenue by Diagnosis and service is visualized by 100% Stacked Bar chart, indicating highest revenue generated from Outpatients for Hypertension and Appendicitis. (53% & 56%) Stable revenue is generated from emergency and Inpatients within scale of (20% to 29%).
- Total revenue generated by department is visualized with the help of Clustered Bar chart with Cardiology generating the highest revenue followed by Orthopedics and General surgery.
- Added a date slicer to visualize the dashboard for particular time periods.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Provider Insights
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Evaluates healthcare provider performance based on efficiency, patient load, and financial contribution. The Total revenue is £3M with a average revenue per patient to £674.

Identifies top and underperforming providers by city and state. Northern Ireland and Wales are the high performing providers While Scotland and England are underperforming. 

Highlights key patterns and changes in performance over time. Most patients are outpatients contributing to the revenue for the diagnosis Hypertension, appendicits, asthma, fracture and Migraine. The Emergency and in-patients are comparatively less between (20 to 29%) contributing to the revenue. This indicates most patients are treated well within time and with appropriate measures. 

Tracks revenue growth, seasonal fluctuations, and provider productivity trends. Cardiology is the most productive department followed by Orthopedics, General surgery, Neurology, Pediatrics. Most of the patients have gone through the procedure of X-rays followed by CT Scan, MRI Scan, Ultrasound and Blood test. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additional Insights -
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Patients residing in Edinburgh followed by Brimingham and Sheffied have the highest insurance coverage indicating higher payment in cash for other cities. 
-Highest services are provided to Wales followed by Northern land and then England by state. Brimingham reporting 996 services received followed by Bristol.
- Highest length of stay for patients is for Northern Ireland followed by Wales for Asthma followed by hypertension in both states.

🔎 Key Insights
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Revenue Growth: Overall revenue showed a steady upward trend, with noticeable seasonal peaks in Q2 and Q4.

Cost Patterns: Operational costs rose in parallel with revenue, suggesting potential inefficiencies in resource allocation.

Provider Performance:

A few providers contributed disproportionately to total revenue, while some underperformed despite similar patient volumes.

High-efficiency providers tended to handle a larger patient load with shorter consultation times.

Patient Trends: An increase in repeat visits indicated growing patient retention, a positive sign for long-term sustainability.

✅ Recommendations
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Optimize Provider Allocation – Reassign patient loads to balance underutilized providers and reduce burnout among top performers.

Cost Control Measures – Investigate rising operational costs during high-revenue quarters to identify waste or inefficiencies.

Incentive Programs – Introduce performance-based incentives for providers to encourage higher efficiency and quality of care.

Focus on Retention – Leverage patient retention trends by offering wellness programs and follow-up care packages.

Strategic Forecasting – Use seasonal revenue patterns to plan staffing, resource allocation, and marketing campaigns.
